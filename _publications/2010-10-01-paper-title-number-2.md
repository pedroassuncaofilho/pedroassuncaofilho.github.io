This article deals with multiobjective composite optimization problems that consist of simultaneously minimizing several objective functions, each of which is composed of a combination of smooth and non-smooth functions. To tackle these problems, we propose a generalized version of the conditional gradient method, also known as Frank-Wolfe method. The method is analysed with three step size strategies, including Armijo-type, adaptive, and diminishing step sizes. We establish asymptotic convergence properties and iteration-complexity bounds, with and without convexity assumptions on the objective functions. Numerical experiments illustrating the practical behaviour of the methods are presented.
